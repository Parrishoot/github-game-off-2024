  - Is THIS your card??
  - ...
  - Okay now that I've dazzled you with my illusions...
  - ...broken down your concept of reality and reassembled in front of you piece
    by piece...
  - I think it's fair to say you owe me one. I don't work for free
  - I need to get this very special deck of cards to the magic castle around the
    corner
  - The only problem is that my rivals are all over the place, trying hard as they
    may to steal my big finale
  - If you can deliver this card to my assistant at the top of the castle, we'll
    call it even
  - Now please... DISAPPEAR!
