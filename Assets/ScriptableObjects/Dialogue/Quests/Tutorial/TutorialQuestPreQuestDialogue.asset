  - Hello Mr. Postal Man! I'm Templatio
  - Why do I look like this? Well it certaintly isn't because the developers ran
    out of time to create a unique character model if that's what you're thinking!
  - One of my favorite hobbies is to tell you things you already know, so here it
    goes!
  - You work for the Ultra Secret Postal Service, or USPS, helping people deliver
    packages with the utmost discretion
  - You can pick up a package with 'E', and throw it with 'Q'!
  - Hold 'Shift' to sprint, 'WASD' to move, 'Space' to jump, you know the drill.
  - Your goal is to help the people of these islands deliver their packages without
    getting caught by their rivals.
  - To ease you into this, try delivering this package around the corner.
  - But be careful of Dark Templatio, a wholly unique character who isn't just me
    with a mustache.
  - If you forget any of the controls, feel free to come back and chat with me. I'm
    very lonely!
